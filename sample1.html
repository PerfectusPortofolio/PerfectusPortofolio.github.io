    <h3 class="pent" style="text-align:center;">10 Of The Dumberest Inventions Ever(sample *no images)</h3>
		<section style="width:100vw">
			<div class ="work" style="text-align:justify;margin-right:1vw; margin-left:1vw;">



								<p> Being an inventor is seldom a simple task. However, several of these may have been conveniently avoided by following the straightforward maxim, "If it ain't broke, don't repair it."</p> <br/>
								
								The Marshall telephone <br/>
								
								<p>There has long been a line of personal headphones with the venerable 11 guitar amplifier company's recognizable emblem. They just took it a step farther by using a Marshall phone. The main distinction? You may share your music with your roadie or sweetheart thanks to the two headphone jacks. Considering that you naturally do it often.</p> <br/>
								
								Bic Lady's Pen 2. <br/>
								
								<p>Ever question if the writing tool you're using is sufficiently gender-specific? Bic is on your side. The For Her Medium Ball Point Pen's "attractive barrel design is available in pink and purple," and it is "Designed to fit comfortably in a woman's hand."</p> <br/>
								
								3. The charger for hydrogen fuel cells <br/>
								
								<p>The UPP fuel cell, which weighs 620g (the same as four iPhones), is designed to be a quick method to recharge your phone when it runs out of juice. Costing $140 up front and $40 for each extra cartridge, the economics don't quite stack up. Not quite prepared to go into the future, the DeLorean.</p>
								
								4. A preview of Kodak Advantix <br/>
								
								<p>Kodak, which created the digital camera, utterly failed to profit from their own technology, which is now available to everyone. Why? mostly because Kodak was a film company. They decided to promote the Advantix Preview instead. Customers may choose which photos to print from a simultaneous film and digital photo shoot using this equipment.</p> <br/>
								
								Internet Kettle 5. <br/>
								
								<p>Ever wished you could start your kettle from a different continent? Obviously not, no. What about coming from above? Maybe, but by the time you've pulled out the app and learned how to use it, you've probably already started cooking. The kettle still has to have water put into it physically.</p>
								
								6. USB toaster <br/>
								
								<p>You know those times when you really want some toast but there isn't a plug nearby? Well, you do have some bread and a fully charged laptop that you can use to connect a USB toaster into?</p>
								
								<p>Oh, yes, none exist. fantastic novelty 0 functionality now sent to history's scrap heap.</p> <br/>
								
								7. Switches with claps <br/>
								
								<p>You could choose light switches that react to your every clap if you don't have the energy to go to the wall to turn your lights on or off. Clap operated switches, which were almost exclusively used in the 1960s, lost popularity as anything from slamming doors to stray cats to, well, pretty much everything, started to instantly turn into a disco.</p> <br/>
								
								8. Scales with Internet access <br/>
								
								<p> Tweet your every action, cake, and bathroom visit? You may as well announce your rapidly fluctuating weight as well. The most egotistical slimmers in the world may find it motivating, but it turns out that the majority of us would prefer to keep our excess weight a secret.</p> 
								<br/>
								Google Glass 9. <br/>
								
								<p>The search engine giant might have saved some time and money in this situation with a healthy dose of common sense.</p>
								
								<p>Wouldn't it be amazing to have your smartphone overlay the actual world so you could never turn it off and be sure to frighten others around you?</p> <br/>
								
								<p>Um. No. It was quite clear that the game was over as soon as we had White males sporting Google Glass.</p> <br/>
								
								10. The Apple Watch. <br/>
								
								<p>Although we fell short on the list by one, smart watches in general are coming up quickly to replace that spot. OK, so we're not quite there yet. Samsung and Apple would want to quickly reverse their years of persuading us to put away our watches in favor of our phones. The defining quality? not yet revealed. </p>
