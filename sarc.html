Which is exactly what a company promised to deliver in the 1990s. A group of nobodies claimed to have discovered the secret to time travel and were looking for investors to fund their research. Many entrepreneurs bought into this scheme, only to find out that the company was a scam. They were left with a lot to pay for on their hands and no time-travelling machine to show for it.</p> <br/>

										<p>A man holding a unicorn horn</p> <br/>
										<p>NARRATOR (V.O.): Speaking of theories, a creature named a Unicorn has been theorized to have existed on earth. In the late 2000s, a company claimed they had captured an entire ranch of unicorns. Investors were promised a share of the profits made from the sale of unicorns. Unfortunately, unicorns do not exist, and the company was nothing more than a front for a Ponzi scheme. Investors were left with empty pockets and a tarnished reputation.</p><br/>

										<p>A haunted house with a “For Sale” sign</p> <br/>

In early 2010, a well-organized group of scammers promised to sell shares in a haunted house. They claimed that the house was haunted by a friendly ghost who would bring good luck to the owners. Entrepreneurs who bought into this scheme found out that the ghost was nothing but a fabrication, and the company was nothing more than throwing money into a torn pocket.</p> <br/>
