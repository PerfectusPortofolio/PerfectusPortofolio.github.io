    <h3 class="pent">People who are taking tech inventions too far</h3>
		<section>

								<p>In this day and age, technological innovations have become an integral part of our lives. From smartphones to smart homes, it seems like there's a new gadget for everything. But with all great things, there's always someone who takes it too far. This post is dedicated to all those people who took technological innovations a bit too far and made the rest of us look bad. </p>
								<h2>The Selfie Obsessed</h2>
								<p>First on our list, we have the selfie obsessed. You know who they are, the people who can't go a day without taking a million selfies and sharing them with the world. They've taken the invention of the front-facing camera to a whole new level. Whether it's a selfie with their cat or a group selfie with strangers on the street, they will stop at nothing to get the perfect shot. Just remember, there's a fine line between capturing memories and being a narcissistic monster. </p>
								<h2>The Smart Home Fanatics</h2>
								<p>Next up, we have the smart home fanatics. These are the people who have transformed their homes into a sci-fi movie set. From smart refrigerators that can order groceries for them to smart toilets that have heated seats and built-in bidets, they've taken technology to a whole new level of ridiculous. Sure, it's impressive, but when was the last time you actually needed to control your home's lighting with your smartphone? Is it really necessary to have a smart coffee maker that starts brewing before you even get out of bed? We think not. </p>
								<h2>The Wearable Tech Addicts</h2>
								<p>Then we have the wearable tech addicts. These are the people who have taken wearable technology to a whole new level of absurdity. From smartwatches that can order pizza to smart jewelry that tracks their heart rate, they have it all. But let's be real, who actually needs to track how many steps they take in a day? Just go for a walk, and you'll feel better, we promise. </p>
								<h2>The Virtual Reality Junkies</h2>
								<p>Last but not least, we have the virtual reality junkies. These are the people who have taken virtual reality to a whole new level of escapism. From VR gaming to VR porn, they've found a way to immerse themselves in a digital world and never look back. But let's be honest, it's not healthy to spend all day in a virtual world, no matter how amazing it may seem. There's a real world out there, people!</p>
								<h2>Conclusion</h2>
								<p>In conclusion, technology is amazing, and it has changed the world in so many ways. But as with anything, there are always those who take it too far. So to all those people who have taken technological innovations a bit too far, we salute you. You have made the rest of us look sane in a world that is becoming increasingly ridiculous. Keep up the good work!</p>
