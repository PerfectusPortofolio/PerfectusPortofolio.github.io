		<section>
			<div class ="work">

							
							<h2>1. Start a Time Travel Agency</h2>
							<p>Thinking of taking your business to new heights? Look no further than starting a time travel agency. With the ability to travel back in time, you can beat your competitors to market, undercut their prices and make all the right decisions before they even know what hit them. Who needs hard work and innovation when you have a Delorean and a flux capacitor? Just make sure to dodge any assassins sent from the future to kill your past self.</p>
							
							<h2>2. Hire a Psychic to Read Your Competitors' Minds</h2>
							<p>Why spend all that time and energy on market research when you can just have a psychic read your competitors' minds for you? Not only will you be able to see their every move before they make it, but you'll also be able to use your newfound knowledge to scare the bejeezus out of them with your seemingly psychic abilities. Just make sure to keep the tarot cards and crystal balls out of sight when you have business meetings, unless you want to give your investors the wrong impression.</p>
							
							<h2>3. Get a Magical Unicorn to Draw Customers to Your Store</h2>
							<p>Unicorns are all the rage these days, and what better way to capitalize on that trend than by getting a magical unicorn to draw customers to your store? With its sparkly mane, shimmering horn, and the ability to grant wishes, your unicorn will be the talk of the town and bring in business like you wouldn't believe. Just make sure to have plenty of carrots and glitter on hand, and watch out for any pesky dragon attacks.</p>
							
							<h2>4. Hire a Wizard to Cast Growth Spells</h2>
							<p>Tired of traditional methods for growing your business? Why not try something a little more unconventional and hire a wizard to cast growth spells for you? With the power of magic, you'll be able to increase your profits, expand your reach, and conquer new markets with ease. Just make sure to find a wizard who knows a spell for avoiding angry mobs of muggles with pitchforks.</p>
							
							<h2>5. Train a Dragon to Guard Your Business</h2>
							<p>Nothing says "don't mess with me" like a fire-breathing dragon guarding your business. Not only will your dragon be a fierce deterrent to any would-be robbers, but it will also attract plenty of attention and bring in curious customers who want to see the dragon up close. Just make sure to invest in fireproofing and dragon-proof insurance.</p>
							
							<h2>6. Turn Your Business into a Haunted House</h2>
							<p>Halloween is the spookiest holiday of the year, and what better way to capitalize on that than by turning your business into a haunted house? With ghosts, goblins, and ghoulish decorations, your business will be the talk of the town and attract plenty of customers who are looking for a good scare. Just make sure to keep the "real" ghosts out of sight, unless you want to be haunted year-round.</p>
							
							<h2>7. Make a Deal with the Devil</h2>
							 <p>Feeling desperate to grow your business? Why not make a deal with the devil? With his vast knowledge, cunning abilities, and access to the dark arts, the devil will be able to help you grow your business in ways you never thought possible. Just make sure to read the fine print and watch out for any traps, or you may end up selling your soul for a one-way ticket to Hell.</p>
